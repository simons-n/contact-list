Ruby is primarily a purely Object-Oriented programming language with features of Functional Programming, and both Imperative Programming and Declarative Programming[1].  The fact that Ruby is Object-Oriented is clear because every value in Ruby is an object, including values of that would be primitive types in many other languages [1].  This is apparent because values of any type in Ruby can have both instance variables and methods.  Additionally, Ruby supports some features of Functional Programming.  However, functions in Ruby are not inherently first-class functions (which is an aspect of functional programming), there are ways in which functions in Ruby can be treated as though they are first-class [2].  For example, blocks of code used to execute a function in Ruby can be packaged in a Proc, which serves as an object that can be used to allow Ruby functions to be passed as arguments or returned by other functions [3].  Furthermore, as mentioned, Ruby also possesses some features of Imperative Programming languages.  Code in Ruby can be written as a series of sequential steps (for example, code involving loops and if-statements), which is a key feature of Imperative Programming [4].  However, Ruby programs need not be programmed in this way, because they can also be coded with a style that better reflects Declarative Programming [5].  While Ruby code can follow a step-by-step "how?" method of programming, it can also follow a higher level, declarative paradigm that allows programmers to think in a way more natural to the non-programming mind, by more or less just typing "what" you want a program to do[5].
